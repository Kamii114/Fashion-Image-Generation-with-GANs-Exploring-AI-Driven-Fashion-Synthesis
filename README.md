# Leveraging GANs for Improved Fashion Image Classification

This project employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve fashion image classification results. By generating synthetic fashion images, we aim to augment the existing dataset, thereby enhancing the performance of classification models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/AemikaChow/AiDLab-fAshIon-Data/blob/main/Datasets/cleaned-maryland.md).

## Project Overview
Generative Adversarial Networks consist of two neural networks, a Generator and a Discriminator, that compete against each other. The Generator creates new images, while the Discriminator evaluates their authenticity against real images. This dynamic allows the model to learn and produce increasingly realistic images, which can be used to supplement training datasets.

### Key Components
1. **Data Processing**: The project involves preprocessing the fashion images, including normalization and resizing to ensure uniformity in the input data.
2. **Model Architecture**:
   - **Generator**: Responsible for generating new images based on random noise input.
   - **Discriminator**: Evaluates the authenticity of the images generated by the Generator.
3. **Training the GAN**: The GAN is trained through an iterative process, where the Generator aims to improve its output quality, while the Discriminator becomes more adept at distinguishing real from generated images.

## Implementation
### Required Libraries
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`
- `opencv`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `tqdm`

### Installation
To install the required libraries, run:
```bash

## Conclusion
By utilizing GANs, this project seeks to enhance the dataset for fashion image classification, leading to improved model performance and more accurate predictions.
